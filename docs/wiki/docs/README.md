# Introduction

MCCoroutine is library which adds extensive support for Kotlin Coroutines on Minecraft Server implementing the **
Bukkit-API** or **Sponge-API**.

Examples for supported frameworks:

* Spigot
* Paper
* CraftBukkit
* SpongeVanilla
* SpongeForge

!!! note "Kotlin Coroutines Description"
    Asynchronous or non-blocking programming is the new reality. Whether we're creating server-side, desktop or mobile
    applications, it's important that we provide an experience that is not only fluid from the user's perspective, but
    scalable when needed. There are many approaches to this problem, and in Kotlin we take a very flexible one by providing
    Coroutine support at the language level and delegating most of the functionality to libraries, much in line with
    Kotlin's philosophy.
